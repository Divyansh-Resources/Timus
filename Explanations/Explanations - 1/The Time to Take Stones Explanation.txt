You probably know the game where two players in turns take 1 to 3 stones from a pile. Looses the one who takes the last stone. We'll generalize this well known game. 
Assume that both of the players can take not 1, 2 or 3 stones, but k1, k2, …, km ones. Again we'll be interested in one question: who wins in the perfect game. 
It is guaranteed that it is possible to make next move irrespective to already made moves.

---------------------------------------------------

In any given position, player 1 checks if he can make a move that takes the game to a position which is winning for player 2. 
(Because he becomes player 2 after making a move)

The winner when there are 0 piles is the first player.
